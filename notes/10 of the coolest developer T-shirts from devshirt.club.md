You spend many hours in front of your computer as a programmer, tapping away at lines of code. But what if you could show off your programming enthusiasm in a new and elegant way? This is where developer t-shirts come in handy. These shirts, which offer unique programming and technology-related designs, allow you to demonstrate your enthusiasm for coding while simultaneously creating a stylish statement.

Today, we'll look at why developer t-shirts are so popular and why every programmer should have a couple on hand. We will be reviewing some cool t-shirts from [devshirt.club](https://www.devshirt.club/).

On their main website they say:

> We are a T-shirt shop for programmers, software engineers and developers.  
> Our T-shirts are cozy and comfy, made out of 100% Cotton materials.  
> Developer T-shirt sizes range from S to 5XL (size guide).  
> We have the t-shirts you deserve, so why not treat yourself ðŸ˜‰

I was given the opportunity to review 10 of them so here are my thoughts.

## 1. [Docker saves the day](https://www.devshirt.club/developer-shirt/docker-saves-the-day)

Docker is like the ultimate support ship for your navy. This is conveyed in beautiful style here in this t-shirt. Every development environment can be the same regardless of the operating system or machine setup. Docker containers work the same across all systems. I really think this t-shirt showcases the power of Docker and lets face it sea animals are pretty cool too.

## 2. [There is no place like 127.0.0.1](https://www.devshirt.club/developer-shirt/there-is-no-place-like-127-0-0-1)

Are you truly a developer if you have not worked on [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) or [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). This t-shirt essentially translates to "There is no place like home". I like the futuristic city vibe it is easily understandable if you are a geek but gives you a conversation starter when talking to less technical people.

## 3. [I are programmer I make computer beep boop](https://www.devshirt.club/developer-shirt/i-are-programmer-i-make-computer-beep-boop)

Space and exploration is always going to be fascinating. The design of this t-shirt reminds me of NASA. It perfectly illustrates just how powerful coding can be because can reach space and go even further beyond. And the cartoon dog is sure to get you some attention as well because most people like pets.

## 4. [Frontend Backend](https://www.devshirt.club/developer-shirt/frontend-backend)

I think this t-shirt is one of the most versatile and coolest ones of the whole collection. Its double sided with one side for frontend and another side for backend. Ultimate geek credibility here. The illustration of both sides is nicely drawn and it makes me think that you are inside of a cool robot.

## 5. [It's harder to read code than to write it](https://www.devshirt.club/reprints/its-harder-to-read-code-than-to-write-it)

This a typical meme that we are all familiar with as programmers. Thats what makes this t-shirt so great its the meme and the humour which is definitely going to lead to some curiosity or a compliment from someone.

## 6. [Build In progress](https://www.devshirt.club/reprints/build-in-progress)

The illustration of the sloth and the words "slacking" pretty much sums up what its like for us developers when we have to wait for our builds to finish or app to compile. Talking to other team mates on Slack does not mean that we are not working.

## 7. [Software Algorithm](https://www.devshirt.club/developer-shirt/software-algorithm)

Creating algorithms can feel like playing around with the dark arts of magic or engineering because its such a technical subject. How many times have you failed to pass a test because you were unable to write working logic? Maybe now this t-shirt will show everyone our inner struggles.

## 8. [Real world coding challenge](https://www.devshirt.club/developer-shirt/real-world-coding-challenge)

Developers are builders and this is well illustrated on this t-shirt. We are always putting things together and building something fun which pushes our imagination and inspires other people to do the same. Robots are also pretty awesome and I don't know about you but it reminds me of that scene in Iron Man with the hammer when Tony Stark is building his first suit.

## 9. [Serverless web scale](https://www.devshirt.club/developer-shirt/serverless-web-scale)

Now this one is quite cool and if you grew up watching The Adventures of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner from the Looney Tunes cartoon then you will recognise the Road Runner character. For those of you who don't know the Road Runner is a speedster so a good representation of serverless which is supposed to be fast.

## 10. [World code control](https://www.devshirt.club/developer-shirt/world-code-control)

I believe that anyone can make it in tech and I really like the illustration on this t-shirt. The fact that it shows different locations is a great way for describing what its like to work remotely as a digital nomad.
![https://res.cloudinary.com/d74fh3kw/image/upload/v1674563812/world-code-control_zti35e.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/d74fh3kw/image/upload/v1674563812/world-code-control_zti35e.jpg)

I hope you found this lighthearted article enlightening. There is no better way for us as developers to showcase are brand and trade in public than wearing a cool programming related t-shirt. There are even more t-shirts available on [devshirt.club](https://www.devshirt.club/) so check them all out!
