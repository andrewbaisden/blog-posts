A lot of people struggle when it comes to thinking of project ideas. Here is a list of 50 cool project ideas that you could build in 2021. I will even give you my technical stack as an example so you can figure out how you could do it too. These applications can be on the web, mobile and desktop. There is an unlimited choice of tools, technologies and programming languages that you could use to build them I am only showing some use cases here. Each project has a programming level of either beginner, intermediate or advanced. And these applications are created to be either front-end, back-end or full-stack.

My current technical stack is:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Redux, Flutter/Dart
Back-End: Python, Node.Js, SQL, NoSQL

## 1. Social Media Dashboard

This could be an app that combines many social media networks into one interface. So for example you could have Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram all together. That means only having one browser tab opened and one unified user interface.

**Programming Level**: Advanced
**Project Type**: Full-Stack

**Front-End**: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Redux, React Native
**Back-End**: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 2. Dating App Manager

An app that would make it easy for you to manage your dating life. Because these days many people tend to use multiple dating apps so it can be hard for you to keep track of the dates you have planned. With this type of app you could keep track of all of the people you are currently talking to as well as basic information such as names, phone numbers, where you met etc...

**Programming Level**: Intermediate
**Project Type**: Full-Stack

**Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native
**Back-End**: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 3. Computer Game Companion App

## 4. Job Search App

How about creating a job search app that feels more like a dating app instead of the traditional serious looking job boards out there. So instead of doing the usual boring job application where you have to submit your CV and then wait for a generic email telling you that they received your application and will get back to you. You are instead given the ability to swipe if you think it's a match or not if you do not think so. Interaction with the hiring manager would feel so much more informal and casual. But of course there should be a way to limit interactions so it does not feel like spam and get overwhelming.

**Programming Level**: Intermediate
**Project Type**: Full-Stack

**Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native
**Back-End**: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 5. 100DaysOfCode App

The 100DaysOfCode challenge helps people to commit to learning how to code consistently. Basically you just use the hashtag for 100DaysOfCode and then use Twitter to tweet your daily progress. At the moment there is no easy way to automatically keep track and schedule tweets for the hashtag. So you creating an app that automatically schedules the tweets as well as any media attached would be quite useful.

## 13. Dating App

The world is already full of dating apps but there is still no stand out app. They all have their pros and cons if you take a look at the reviews for them.

## 16. Developer Freelance Platform

Similar to websites like Upwork and Fiverr however it is a platform that is ONLY for developers. It could be a platform that makes it easy for developers to find and connect with each other and work on projects together through collaboration. So you are not only getting fast and easy real world experience but you are also connecting with developers who are around your skill level. This would be a fantastic way to level up and an easy way for beginners to get work. I think it would be a good idea as it cuts out the recruiter completely and you don't need to stress over interviews. However there could be some form of onboarding and maybe tests depending on the work and the developers who work on it. These can be free open source projects or there can be some salary involved.
